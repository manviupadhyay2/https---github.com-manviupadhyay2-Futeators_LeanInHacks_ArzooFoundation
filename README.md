Arzoo: Har Jeevan Amulya
Arzoo is a website dedicated to supporting human trafficking survivors by providing access to essential resources, raising awareness, and fostering community engagement. 

Project Overview:
Arzoo features a donation portal for supporting survivors financially, blogs by survivors to share their stories and insights, and an online community for survivors, volunteers, and supporters. Additionally, it includes a helpline directory for access to support services, chatbot support for instant assistance, and job opportunities for survivors through vocational training and employment opportunities.
We have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build this website from scratch.
